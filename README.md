#`nestor-qt`
Legacy user-interface to the [nestor](github.com/usnistgov/nestor) workflow.

## Purpose

This interface was designed to help manufacturers "tag" their
maintenance work-order data using the `nestor` workflow. 
It takes advantage of keyword prioritization and relationship/link prediction to assist in dataset labeling *without* having to look at the data document-by-document. 

The current build is an alpha tool built for reasearch purposes, so please be patient while using it. 
See the [main nestor page](github.com/usnistgov/nestor) for more information. 
Ifyou have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us (see [Who
are we?](#who-are-we). )
